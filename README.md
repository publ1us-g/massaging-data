## Usage
This project currently offers one feature: massaging "[Town Hall Project 2018]" Google sheet data and serving it as a REST-ful web service.  You can access the data online: http://138.197.80.213:8080/townhall-massaged .  The data massaging was necessary to provide listing dates in [ISO-8601 format].  

## Primary roadmap
1. Get more people involved 
2. Add REST service to provide upcoming elections (from local school boards all the way up!) Â
